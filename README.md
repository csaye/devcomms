**Devcomms is an open source, developer-focused team communication and coordination tool aiming to simplify and streamline development.** Instead of having one tool for chatting and calling, one tool for arranging notes, and one tool for setting goals and to-dos, you can do all of that and more with Devcomms. **Try it here: [devcomms.io](https://devcomms.io)**

No longer will you have to struggle to coordinate across several apps.
